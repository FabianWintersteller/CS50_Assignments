sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: The sorted data iterates the quickest (O(n)) and reversed the slowest (O(n^2))

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: all data sets are sorted approximately at the same time (O(n log n)), but still faster than sort3 (O(n^2))

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: all data sets are sorted approximately at the same time (O(n^2)), but slower than sort3 (O(n log n))
